# Code-Comment Classification  

This project involves the implementation of a text classification pipeline that processes user comments, converts them into machine-readable formats, and trains machine learning models to predict predefined categories. The system is designed to evaluate the performance of different models and vectorization techniques to determine the most effective approach for text classification.
